          I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where my father was finishing up
          his Ph.D. His birthplace was much farther away, across the Pacific
          Ocean, in a little river town called Qijiang (綦江), now incorporated
          as part of the Chongqing (重庆) Municipality. Back then, it was still
          part of Sichuan (四川) province, which you may know for its famous
          dishes like mapo tofu and dandan noodles.

          My mother was born in Beijing, her father a journalist and college
          graduate who had documented and wrote about his experiences in the
          Korean War, her mother, a zookeeper, until she passed away when my
          mother was twelve.

          My father and mother met in the United States, part of a great wave of
          student-scholars filtered by Deng&apos;s newly reinstated national
          exams, sent forth to learn from a world that had long ago passed China
          in every technological and economic sense. This was 改革开放, the
          great era of Reformation and Opening.
