- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Make all the titles hyperlinks
- [ ] First page load is very slow, maybe from all the audio files
- [ ] Custom audio player. Can find a headless library.
- [ ] More flexible popover orientations. Right now we have fourâ€”one for each corner. We can bump it up to eight so each corner can have two orientations.
- [ ] Definition popover is a little slow
- [ ] Ideally, clicking outside the popover onto the already-highlighted character shouldn't close the popover and then flash it again
- [ ] Make the popover accessible (super not accessible right now)
- [ ] Also make the popover headless, look at Headless UI or Radix UI for inspiration
