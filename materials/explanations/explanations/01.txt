Let's get started.

This verse tries to describe the Dao by, paradoxically, saying it is something we can't truly describe or name. But the Dao is something unified and profound, and I see it as stemming from the same mystical experiences of major religions that cause them to see the unity underlying creation, "seeing God in all things."
