["Let's get started.\n\nThis verse tries to describe the Dao by, paradoxically, saying it is something we can't truly describe or name. But the Dao is something unified and profound, and I see it as stemming from the same mystical experiences of major religions that cause them to see the unity underlying creation, \"seeing God in all things.\"\n\n","The world is given shape by opposing pairs. It rings similar to the Gunas, as described to me in the Bhagavad Gita, where, even though the underlying fabric of reality is unity, our senses—the world we experience—is formed by categorization and separation of things into good and bad, hot and cold, long and short.\n\nHere, the Dao introduces the concept of 无为 (wu2 wei2), 'non-action'. I personally still don't fully grasp what it means. But the lines following give a clue.\n\nThe natural order of the world unfolds of its own accord. You could say, at most, there is a clockwork universe created by God. But does a rock act? Does a tree act? Do animals act? Maybe we could say animals act, but they act in harmony with the rhythmn of life.\n\nTo act without action, to teach without words, could perhaps mean to act without attachment to outcomes, like in the Bhagavad Gita. To teach without words is not to lecture or to pontificate—the life you lead itself is teaching enough."]
