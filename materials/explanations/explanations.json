["This verse describes the Dao by, paradoxically, saying it is something we can't truly describe or name.\nDao (道) means way, or path, and here we capitalize Way to differentiate it from just a generic path through your backyard.\nThe unchanging Way, the unchanging Name, are too profound, too great, to be something we can capture with mere speech.\nBeing and emptiness are just two sides of the same coin. Both stem from the same unity underlying all reality.\nUnderstanding this is the key to understanding all.","The world is given shape by opposing pairs. It rings similar to the Gunas, as described to me in the Bhagavad Gita, where, even though the underlying fabric of reality is unity, our senses—the world we experience—is formed by categorization and separation of things into good and bad, hot and cold, long and short.\n\nHere, the Dao introduces the concept of 无为 (wu2 wei2), 'non-action'. I personally still don't fully grasp what it means. But the lines following give a clue.\n\nThe natural order of the world unfolds of its own accord. You could say, at most, there is a clockwork universe created by God. But does a rock act? Does a tree act? Do animals act? Maybe we could say animals act, but they act in harmony with the rhythmn of life.\n\nTo act without action, to teach without words, could perhaps mean to act without attachment to outcomes, like in the Bhagavad Gita. To teach without words is not to lecture or to pontificate—the life you lead itself is teaching enough."]
