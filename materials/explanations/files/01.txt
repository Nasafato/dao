This verse describes the Dao by, paradoxically, saying it is something we can't truly describe or name.
Dao (ÈÅì) means way, or path, and here we capitalize Way to differentiate it from just a generic path through your backyard.
The unchanging Way, the unchanging Name, are too profound, too great, to be something we can capture with mere speech.
Being and emptiness are just two sides of the same coin. Both stem from the same unity underlying all reality.
Understanding this is the key to understanding all.
