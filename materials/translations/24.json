  "legge": "He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Dao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Dao do not adopt and allow them.",
  "susuki": "One on tiptoe is not steady; One astride makes no advance. Seff-displayers are not enlightened, Self-asserters lack distinction, Self-approvers have no merit, And self-seekers stunt their lives. Before Reason this is like surfeit of food; it is like a wen on the body with which people are apt to be disgusted. Therefore the man of reason will not indulge in it.",
  "goddard": "It is not natural to stand on tiptoe, or being astride one does not walk. One who displays himself is not bright, or one who asserts himself cannot shine. A self-approving man has no merit, nor does one who praises himself grow. The relation of these things (self-display, self-assertion, self-approval) to Dao is the same as offal is to food. They are excrescences from the system; they are detestable; Dao does not dwell in them."
