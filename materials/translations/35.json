  "legge": "To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Dao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Dao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible.",
  "susuki": "\"Who holdeth fast to the great Form, Of him the world will come in quest: For there we never meet with harm, There we find shelter, comfort, rest.\" Music with dainties makes the passing stranger stop. But Reason, when coming from the mouth, how tasteless is it! It has no flavor. When looked at, there is not enough to be seen; when listened to, there is not enough to be heard. However, when used, it is inexhaustible.",
  "goddard": "The world will go to him who grasps this Great Principle; they will seek and not be injured, they will find contentment, peace and rest. Music and dainties attract the passing people, while Dao's reality seen-is insipid. Indeed it has no taste, when looked at there is not enough seen to be prized, when listened for, it can scarcely be heard, but, the use of it is inexhaustible."
