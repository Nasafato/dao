  "legge": "Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one see the Dao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so.",
  "susuki": "\"Without passing out of the gate The world's course I prognosticate. Without peeping through the window The heavenly Reason I contemplate. The further one goes, The less one knows.\" Therefore the holy man does not travel, and yet he has knowledge. He does not see things, and yet he defines them. He does not labor, and yet he completes.",
  "goddard": "Not going out of the door I have knowledge of the world. Not peeping through the window I perceive heaven's Dao. The more one wander to a distance the less he knows. Therefore the wise man does not wander about but he understands, he does not see things but he defines them, he does not labor yet he completes."
