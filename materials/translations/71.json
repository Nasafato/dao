  "legge": "To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it.",
  "susuki": "To know the unknowable, that is elevating. Not to know the knowable, that is sickness. Only by becoming sick of sickness can we be without sickness. The holy man is not sick. Because he is sick of sickness, therefore he is not sick.",
  "goddard": "To recognize one's ignorance of unknowable things is mental health, and to be ignorant of knowable things is sickness. Only by grieving over ignorance of knowable things are we in mental health. The wise man is wise because he understands his ignorance and is grieved over it."
