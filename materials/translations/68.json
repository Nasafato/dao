  "legge": "He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. Thus we say, \"He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.\" Thus we say, \"Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.\" Thus we say, \"Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.\"",
  "susuki": "He who excels as a warrior is not warlike. He who excels as a fighter is not wrathful. He who excels in conquering the enemy does not strive. He who excels in employing men is lowly. This is called the virtue of not-striving. This is called utilizing men's ability. This is called complying with heaven-since olden times the highest.",
  "goddard": "He who excels as a soldier is the one who is not warlike; he who fights the best fight is not wrathful; he who best conquers an enemy is not quarrelsome; he who best employs people is obedient himself. This is the virtue of not-quarreling, this is the secret of bringing out other men's ability, this is complying with Heaven. Since of old it is considered the greatest virtue (de [teh])."
