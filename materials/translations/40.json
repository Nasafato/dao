  "legge": "The movement of the Dao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Dao's mighty deeds. All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named).",
  "susuki": "\"Homeward is Reason's course, Weakness is Reason's force.\" Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things come from existence, but existence comes from non-existence.",
  "goddard": "Retirement is characteristic of Dao just as weakness appears to be a characteristic of its activity. Heaven and earth and everything are produced from existence, but existence comes from nonexistence."
