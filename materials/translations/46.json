  "legge": "When the Dao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Dao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency.",
  "susuki": "When the world possesses Reason, race horses are reserved for hauling dung. When the world is without Reason, war horses are bred in the common. No greater sin than yielding to desire. No greater misery than discontent. No greater calamity than greed. Therefore, he who knows content's content is always content.",
  "goddard": "When the world yields to Dao, race horses will be used to haul manure. When the world ignores Dao war horses are pastured on the public common. There is no sin greater than desire. There is no misfortune greater than discontent. There is no calamity greater than acquisitiveness. Therefore to know extreme contentment is simply to be content."
