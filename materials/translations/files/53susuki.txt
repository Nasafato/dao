If I have ever so little knowledge, I shall walk in the great Reason. It is but expansion that I must fear. The great Reason is very plain, but people are fond of by-paths. When the palace is very splendid, the fields are very weedy and granaries very empty. To wear ornaments and gay clothes, to carry sharp swords, to be excessive in drinking and eating, to have a redundance of costly articles, this is the pride of robbers. Surely, this is un-Reason.
