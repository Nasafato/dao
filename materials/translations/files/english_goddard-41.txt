The superior scholar when he considers Dao earnestly practices it; An average scholar listening to Dao sometimes follows it and sometimes loses it; An inferior scholar listening to Dao ridicules it. Were it not thus ridiculed it could not be regarded as Dao. Therefore the writer says: Those who are most illumined by Dao are the most obscure. Those advanced in Dao are most retiring. Those best guided by Dao are the least prepossessing. The high in virtue (de [teh]) resemble a lowly valley; the whitest are most likely to be put to shame; the broadest in virtue resemble the inefficient. The most firmly established in virtue resemble the remiss. The simplest chastity resembles the fickle, the greatest square has no corner, the largest vessel is never filled. The greatest sound is void of speech, the greatest form has no shape. Tao is obscure and without name, and yet it is precisely this Dao that alone can give and complete.
