My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practise, but in the world no one can understand, no one can practise them. Words have an ancestor; Deeds have a master [viz., Reason]. Since he is not understood, therefore I am not understood. Those who understand me are few, and thus I am distinguished. Therefore the holy man wears wool, and hides in his bosom his jewels.
