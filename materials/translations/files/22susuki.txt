"The crooked shall be straight, Crushed ones recuperate, The empty find their fill. The worn with strength shall thrill; Who little have receive, And who have much will grieve." Therefore the holy man embraces unity and becomes for all the world a model. Not self-displaying he is enlightened; Not self -approving he is distinguished; Not self-asserting he acquires merit; Not self-seeking he gaineth life. Since he does not quarrel, therefore no one in the world can quarrel with him. The saying of the ancients: "The crooked shall be straight," is it in any way vainly spoken? Verily, they will be straightened and return home.
