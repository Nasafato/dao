Abandon your saintliness; put away your prudence; and the people will gain a hundredfold! Abandon your benevolence; put away your justice; and the people will return to filial piety and paternal devotion. Abandon smartness; give up greed; and thieves and robbers will no longer exist. These are three things for which culture is insufficient. Therefore it is said: "Hold fast to that which will endure, Show thyself simple, preserve thee pure, And lessen self with desires fewer."
