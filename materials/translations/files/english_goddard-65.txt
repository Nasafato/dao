In the olden days those who obeyed the spirit of Dao did not enlighten the people but kept them simple hearted. The reason people are difficult to govern is because of their smartness; likewise to govern a people with guile is a curse; and to govern them with simplicity is a blessing. He who remembers these two things is a model ruler. Always to follow this standard and rule is de [teh], the profound. Profound de [teh] is deep indeed and far reaching. The very opposite of common things, but by it one obtains obedient subjects.
