"Greatest perfection imperfect will be, But its work ne'er waneth. Greatest fullness is vacuity, Its work unexhausted remaineth." "Straightest lines resemble curves; Greatest skill like a tyro serves; Greatest eloquence stammers and swerves." Motion conquers cold. Quietude conquers heat. Purity and clearness are the world's standard.
