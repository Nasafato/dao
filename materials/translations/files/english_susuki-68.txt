He who excels as a warrior is not warlike. He who excels as a fighter is not wrathful. He who excels in conquering the enemy does not strive. He who excels in employing men is lowly. This is called the virtue of not-striving. This is called utilizing men's ability. This is called complying with heaven-since olden times the highest.
