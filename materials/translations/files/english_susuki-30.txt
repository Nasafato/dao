He who with Reason assists the master of mankind will not with arms strengthen the empire. His methods invite requital. Where armies are quartered briars and thorns grow. Great wars unfailingly are followed by famines. A good man acts resolutely and then stops. He ventures not to take by force. Be resolute but not boastful; resolute but not haughty; resolute but not arrogant; resolute because you cannot avoid it; resolute but not violent. Things thrive and then grow old. This is called un-Reason. Un-Reason soon ceases.
