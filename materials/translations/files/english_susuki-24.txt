One on tiptoe is not steady; One astride makes no advance. Seff-displayers are not enlightened, Self-asserters lack distinction, Self-approvers have no merit, And self-seekers stunt their lives. Before Reason this is like surfeit of food; it is like a wen on the body with which people are apt to be disgusted. Therefore the man of reason will not indulge in it.
