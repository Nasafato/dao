If the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by death? If we make people fear death, and supposing some would [still] venture to rebel, if we seize them for capital punishment, who will dare? There is always an executioner who kills.

If a man takes the place of the great carpenter who hews, he will rarely, indeed, fail to injure his hand.
