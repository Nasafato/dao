He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. Thus we say, "He ne'er contends, And therein is his might." Thus we say, "Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite." Thus we say, "Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright."
