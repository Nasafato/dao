Not esteeming the worthy will prevent the people from competing; Not valuing the rare will prevent the people from becoming outlaws; Not eyeing the desirable will prevent the people's hearts from becoming agitated. Thus do the wise governâ€”emptying the people's hearts, filling theirs bellies, weakening their ambitions, strengthening their bodies. Absolve the people of knowledge and desires. Manage the clever so they will not upend the order. Acting without action, there is nothing that cannot be governed.
