Colour's five hues from the eyes their sight will take. Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste. The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange. Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former.
