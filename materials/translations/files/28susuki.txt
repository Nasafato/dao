"Who his manhood shows And his womanhood knows Becomes the empire's river. Is he the empire's river, He will from virtue never deviate, And home he turneth to a child's estate. "Who his brightness shows And his blackness knows Becomes the empire's model. Is he the empire's model, Of virtue ne'er shall he be destitute, And home he turneth to the absolute. "Who knows his fame And guards his shame Becomes the empire's valley. Is he the empire's valley, For e'er his virtue will sufficient be, And home he turneth to simplicity." Simplicity, when scattered, becomes a vessel of usefulness. The holy man, by using it, becomes the chief leader; and truly, a great principle will never do harm.
