"The five colors [combined] the human eye will blind; The five notes [in one sound] the human ear confound; The five tastes [when they blend] the human mouth offend." "Racing and hunting will human hearts turn mad, Treasures high-prized make human conduct bad." Therefore the holy man attends to the inner and not to the outer. He abandons the latter and chooses the former.
