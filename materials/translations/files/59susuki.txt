To govern the people is the affair of heaven and there is nothing like thrift. Now consider that thrift is said to come from early practice. By early practice it is said that we can accumulate an abundance of virtue. If one accumulates an abundance of virtue then there is nothing that can not be overcome. When nothing can not be overcome then no one knows his limit. When no one knows his limit one can have possession of the commonwealth. Who has possession of the commonwealth's mother [thrift] may last and abide. This is called the possession of deep roots and of a staunch stem. To life, to everlastingness, to comprehension, this is the way.
