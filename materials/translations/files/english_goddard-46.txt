When the world yields to Dao, race horses will be used to haul manure. When the world ignores Dao war horses are pastured on the public common. There is no sin greater than desire. There is no misfortune greater than discontent. There is no calamity greater than acquisitiveness. Therefore to know extreme contentment is simply to be content.
