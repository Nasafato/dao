The heavy is the root of the light; the quiet is master of motion. Therefore the wise man in all the experience of the day will not depart from dignity. Though he be surrounded with sights that are magnificent, he will remain calm and unconcerned.

Because being flippant himself, he has lost the respect of his subjects; being passionate himself, he has lost the control of the Empire.
