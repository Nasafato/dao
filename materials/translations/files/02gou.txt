When all under heaven knows the beautiful to be beautiful, so exists the ugly; When all know the good to be good, so exists the bad. Presence and absence give rise to each other, difficulty and ease create each other, long and short form each other, high and low fill each other, sound and noise harmonize with each other, front and back follow each other. Thus, the wise operate without action, and teach without words. All creation starts without beginning, creates without possessing, acts without attaching, and when the work is done, takes no credit. Because it desires no praise, it will go on forever.
