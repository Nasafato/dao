"Who holdeth fast to the great Form, Of him the world will come in quest: For there we never meet with harm, There we find shelter, comfort, rest." Music with dainties makes the passing stranger stop. But Reason, when coming from the mouth, how tasteless is it! It has no flavor. When looked at, there is not enough to be seen; when listened to, there is not enough to be heard. However, when used, it is inexhaustible.
