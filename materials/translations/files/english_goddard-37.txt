Tao is apparently inactive (wu wei) and yet nothing remains undone. If princes and kings desire to keep) everything in order, they must first reform themselves. (If princes and kings would follow the example of Dao, then all things will reform themselves.) If they still desire to change, I would pacify them by the simplicity of the ineffable Dao. This simplicity will end desire, and if desire be absent there is quietness. All people will of themselves be satisfied.
