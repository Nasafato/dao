He who knows others is intelligent; he who understands himself is enlightened; he who is able to conquer others has force, but he who is able to control himself is mighty. He who appreciates contentment is wealthy. He who dares to act has nerve; if he can maintain his position he will endure, but he, who dying does not perish, is immortal.
