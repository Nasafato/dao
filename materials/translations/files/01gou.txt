The way that can be explained, is not the unchanging Way. The name that can be named, is not the unchanging Name. 
Emptiness, is the beginning of heaven and earth; Being, is the mother of all creation. 
In unchanging Emptiness, one can observe the mysteries of the universe; In unchanging Being, one can observe the outlines of all things. 
These two spring from the same source, differing only in name. 
Both are profoundâ€”and deep beyond deep, they are the door to all mysteries.
