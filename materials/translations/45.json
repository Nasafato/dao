  "legge": "Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven.",
  "susuki": "\"Greatest perfection imperfect will be, But its work ne'er waneth. Greatest fullness is vacuity, Its work unexhausted remaineth.\" \"Straightest lines resemble curves; Greatest skill like a tyro serves; Greatest eloquence stammers and swerves.\" Motion conquers cold. Quietude conquers heat. Purity and clearness are the world's standard.",
  "goddard": "Extreme perfection seems imperfect, its function is not exhausted. Extreme fullness appears empty, its function is not exercised. Extreme straightness appears crooked; great skill, clumsy; great eloquence, stammering. Motion conquers cold, quietude conquers heat. Not greatness but purity and clearness are the world's standard."
