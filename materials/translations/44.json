  "legge": "Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings sorrow and pain more near? Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he.",
  "susuki": "\"Name or person, which is more near? Person or fortune, which is more dear? Gain or loss, which is more sear? \"Extreme dotage leadeth to squandering. Hoarded wealth inviteth plundering. \"Who is content incurs no humiliation, Who knows when to stop risks no vitiation, Forever lasteth his duration.\"",
  "goddard": "Which is nearer, a name or a person? Which is more, personality or treasure? Is it more painful to gain or to suffer loss? Extreme indulgence certainly greatly wastes. Much hoarding certainly invites severe loss. A contented person is not despised. One who knows when to stop is not endangered; he will be able therefore to continue."
